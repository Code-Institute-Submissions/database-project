## Responsiveness
This site was was tested on multiple browsers (Google Chrome, Mozzila Firefox and Opera), multiple mobile devices (Samsung Galaxy, Huawei, Sony) and tablet device(Samsung Galaxy Tab) and it shown responsivness and compatibility.
Web-site is responsive for screens from 350px to 2k. Everything is in order and responsive. But, viewing it on a 4k desktop, Home page carousels are too small and they cover 2/3 of the width. 
Marketplace adverts card are 4 in a row and they appear stretched. It would be great if they would be showing 6 in a row instead of 4. Add advert and Edit advert are small pages and there is not enough content on them to fill a 4k screen height.
